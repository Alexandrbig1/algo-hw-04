## Testing results (sec)

| Array size | Insertion Sort | Merge Sort | Timsort |
|------------|----------------|------------|---------|
| 1000 | 0.13482 | 0.00978 | 0.00062 |
| 2000 | 0.56905 | 0.02173 | 0.00110 |

## Results: Timsort is faster than Insertion Sort. Merge Sort is a little slower than Timsort but still faster than Insertion Sort because it combines both algorithms.
